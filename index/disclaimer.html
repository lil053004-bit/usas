            <h2 class="section-title">2. Substantial Risk of Loss</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>WARNING:</strong> Trading and investing involves substantial risk. Key risks include:
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Market Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Stock prices can be highly volatile and may fluctuate significantly due to market conditions, economic factors, company performance, political events, and other factors beyond anyone's control. You could lose a substantial portion or all of your investment.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Volatility Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Securities markets can experience extreme price volatility. Rapid price changes can result in significant losses in a short period of time. High volatility increases the risk of substantial losses.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Liquidity Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Some securities may be difficult to buy or sell quickly. Limited liquidity can result in significant losses if you cannot exit a position at your desired price.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Leverage Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Using leverage (borrowed money) magnifies both gains and losses. You can lose more than your initial investment when using leverage. Leverage substantially increases risk.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Company-Specific Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Individual companies may face operational challenges, management issues, competitive pressures, regulatory problems, or bankruptcy. Company-specific events can cause rapid and severe price declines.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">3. Past Performance Warning</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Past performance is not indicative of future results. Historical returns, analysis, or patterns do NOT guarantee future performance. Any historical data or analysis should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just because a stock performed well in the past does NOT mean it will perform well in the future. Market conditions change, and historical patterns may not repeat.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">4. No Guarantees</h2>
            <p>

            </p>
